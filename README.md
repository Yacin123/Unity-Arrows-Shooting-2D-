# About the Project
This project is made using unity as a GameEngine and c# for scripting the behaviors.
Exactly the creation of this project was made to illustrate the mechanics of:
  1. Rotating a GameObject in the direction of the mouse pointer.
  2. Instantiating an GameObject in the direction of mouse pointer and also with a rotation that pointes that direction.
  3. Assigning a velocity to the instantiated GameObject
